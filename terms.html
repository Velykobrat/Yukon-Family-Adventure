        <p class="terms-text">
          These terms and conditions apply to the Yukon: Family Adventure app
          (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was
          created by (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free
          service.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically
          agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you
          thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the
          Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application,
          any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited.
          Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate
          the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions
          are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and
          other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain
          the property of the Service Provider.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is
          as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the
          right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any
          time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any
          charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
          communicated to you.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
          provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It
          is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
          access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise
          against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing
          software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
          operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone
          to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's
          security features, and may result in the Application not functioning
          correctly or at all.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that
          have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms
          and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the
          Application:
        </p>
        <ul class="terms-list">

            <a
              href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
              target="_blank"

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="terms-text">
          Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume
          responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application
          require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided
          by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held
          responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due
          to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data
          allowance.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be
          aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.
          Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
          usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party
          charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any
          such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the
          application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country)
          without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
          device on which you are using the application, they assume that you
          have obtained permission from the bill payer.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility
          for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your
          responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your
          device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service,
          the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the
          application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure
          that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third
          parties to provide information to them so that they can make it
          available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any
          loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying
          entirely on this functionality of the application.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-text">
          The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point.
          The application is currently available as per the requirements for the
          operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend
          the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need
          to download the updates if you want to continue using the application.
          The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
          application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
          particular operating system version installed on your device. However,
          you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to
          you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the
          application and may terminate its use at any time without providing
          termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
          termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
          will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary)
          delete it from your device.
        </p>
